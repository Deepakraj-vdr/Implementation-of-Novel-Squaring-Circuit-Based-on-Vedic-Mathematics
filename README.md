# Implementation-of-Novel-Squaring-Circuit-Based-on-Vedic-Mathematics
Squaring operations are crucial in signal processing but often lack dedicated units, relying instead on multipliers. This projects presents a novel squaring circuit using the YTVY sutra from Vedic mathematics, designed without multipliers. Implemented in VHDL and synthesized in Altera Quartus Prime.
